How would this translate to a GitHub Action Pipeline library? Is this really the solution we want to go for or can we just start creating workflows and actions and then post them up on our internal github marketplace catelogue for consumption?

I\u0026rsquo;m preparing scripts that are self serve for teams across an enterprise to scan their Jenkins controller\u0026rsquo;s and return all the plugin\u0026rsquo;s they are currently using with the version numbers. We\u0026rsquo;re preparing for a major upgrade that\u0026rsquo;ll remove the support of dockershim based on the latest updates from kubernetes. Upgrades are always very procedural and you have to take things step by step, which I really like. The only thing you have to watch out for is to mitigate the unknown issues that may arise from these major upgrades (hence the audit). We\u0026rsquo;re combing through the enterprise pod templates and making sure that the newly upgraded platform can support the existing pods we have or if we may need to upgrade these images as well.\nRepos for the week # imranalley/go-track Go 0 0 Continuing my progress to learn golang Musings # Burning in the background is an enterprise strategy to shift our main DevOps CI/CD activities to GitHub Actions. It\u0026rsquo;s always interesting to plan out how to set up this enterprise offering so people can easily adopt to the platform and the controls you want to have in place to mitigate risk. Questions that come to mind:\nHow should we set up the organization/teams structure Should we lockdown secrets for the enterprise to push people to use the Enterprise approved tools (Vault/CyberArk) Runners compute and scaling solution How should we support open-source actions within the enterprise Adoption/migration strategy from Jenkins to GHA Things I\u0026rsquo;m excited for next week # Building out self-serve actions for the enterprise to audit their Jenkins plugins Blasting our pods and testing them to smithereens for our upgrade ","date":"3 November 2023","permalink":"/standups/ws-1/","section":"Weekly Standups","summary":"Welcome to my weekly standups - a series where I share what I\u0026rsquo;m working on, thoughts rummaging around in my head, and what I\u0026rsquo;m excited for next week! ðŸš€ What I\u0026rsquo;m working on # Everyone\u0026rsquo;s favourite topic, audit.","title":"WS-1: Scaling DevOps Across an Enterprise"},{"content":" The Start of a Journey # For the longest time, I had a fear of public speaking. When I was promoted to a Senior DevOps Consultant role, I was thrown into a bunch of calls around cloud architecture and solutions that would fit an entire enterprise of 40,000+ employees. Needless to say, it was absolutely daunting. I was faced with the day-to-day tasks of talking with directors, managers, other senior engineers on my personal viewpoints when it came to engineering solutions. I quickly came to realize that improving my public speaking skills would greatly benefit not just my career but my whole life. Having an idea and then having the ability to communicate the idea to someone else effectively without little to no information loss is a SUPERPOWER and I wanted it.\nCue October 2022, when I signed up for a public speaking course at Speakwell. My coach, Jordyn, and I went through my biggest pain points when I came to public speaking. They revolved around communication structure, clarity, and mindset.\nMy Learnings # Having structures on command that you can use to articulate ideas This involves ordering information in the following structures: Chronological: Past, Present, Future Numerical: 1, 2, 3 Cost, Benefits, Analysis Cause/Effect: Cause, Short Term Effects, Long Term Effects Reducing Filler words and being comfortable with a pause Having a growth mindset and being able to brush off mistakes/hiccups when it comes to public speaking From my learnings, I went on to talk in a Software Circus where we chat about technical and non-technical topics. Afterwards, I had the opportunity to host the first ever Software Circus in Toronto as well! The team also knew of my goals when it came to public speaking and would pass my name along for opportunities to join webinars and internal conference calls. You can see one of the webinars with the Uptime community here.\nOverall, improving my public speaking was one of the best undertakings of my career and itâ€™s a lifelong learning process. If youâ€™re looking for someone to speak at a conference/webinar youâ€™re organizing, feel free to reach out!\n","date":"18 September 2023","permalink":"/projects/public-speaking/","section":"Projects","summary":"The Start of a Journey # For the longest time, I had a fear of public speaking.

Even the auditing team (if you had a chance to ask them). The reason? Zero traceability of artifacts, attestations can be lost in transit, the bureaucratic nature of approvals and administration, just to name a few. One of the most common auditing scenarios is to audit repos where devs, ops, admins, and QA all work within the same repository. How can we keep track of changes to access levels within this repo in an automated way? Enter GitHub Actions.\nAuditing within GitHub # GitHub already has audit capabilities built in with Audit Log. The problem with this is that the built in search functionality would be manual work for your administrators. If a team ever had to do a quick audit on their repo, they would also have to reach out to the enterprise admins of their GitHub instance. Why create more tickets when this can be self-serviced and automated?\nCreating the Action # imranalley/enterprise-audit-action A GitHub Action that can be leveraged to audit enterprise github repos, teams, orgs, and users Python 0 0 The Enterprise Audit Action can be onboarded to very quickly.\nClone the repo to your github enterprise instance\u0026rsquo;s ./actions repo. Users can copy and paste the following to their .github/workflows folder: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 name: Enterprise Audit Action on: workflow_dispatch: jobs: audit: runs-on: ubuntu-latest steps: # Checks-out your repository under $GITHUB_WORKSPACE, so your job can access it - uses: actions/checkout@v3 # Use Enterprise Audit Action - name: Run a one-line script uses: # Enter the location where your ./actions repo is with: token: ${{ secrets.GH_TOKEN }} organization: # Org Name repository: # Repo Name owner: # Owner Name team: # Team Name user: # User\u0026#39;s Name audit: # Audit use case (must be 1 of the following: org, repo, team, or user) instance: # API endpoint as per your Enterprise GitHub Instance (public: https://api.github.com/graphql) - name: Publish CSV Report uses: actions/upload-artifact@v2 with: name: ghe-acl path: ghe-acl*.csv Feel free to edit other settings such as triggering the workflow every day on a cron schedule.\nThe token (L17) must have admin access based on the audit use case. If you are auditing at an organization level, the token must have admin access to the organization being audited. Run the workflow in your actions tab!
